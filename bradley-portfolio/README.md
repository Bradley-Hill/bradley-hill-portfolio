# <p align="center">My Portfolio</p>

My first non-trivial project using React.js and first time using Tailwind, hoping to have a presentable and effective portfolio page to show off my previously completed projects.

-Had some trouble with the projectItem -> ExpandedProject transition effect, used the react-transition-group module, and got the desired effect working on the opening direction but the collapsing transition wants happening, due to the component being unmounted from the DOM instantly, added a timeout to allow the transition time to be visible and it works...perhaps not teh most elegant solution but it works as I had hoped.
