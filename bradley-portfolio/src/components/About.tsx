            Greetings! I'm Bradley Hill, and I'm thrilled to present my Next.js
            portfolio project, showcasing my tech journey from the 2021 Covid-19
            lockdown to 9 months at Ada Tech School in Nantes. Proficient in
            HTML/CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and frameworks like Vue/React/Next
            and Nuxt, I've expanded into PHP, Java, SQL, Python, and computer
            science fundamentals.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-4 max-w-2xl text-xl text-gray-500 lg:mx-auto">
            One highlight of my Ada Tech School experience has been working on
            collaborative projects, providing me with invaluable insights into
            teamworking in a new environment and the different professional
            methodologies. This contrasts with my earlier self-study and allows
            me the opportunity to apply my skills in new settings.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 max-w-2xl text-xl text-gray-500 lg:mx-auto">
            Beyond tech, you'll find me immersed in gardening and exploring
            fantasy and science-fiction books. Let's connect and discuss how I
            can bring my skills and passion to your team!
          </p>
