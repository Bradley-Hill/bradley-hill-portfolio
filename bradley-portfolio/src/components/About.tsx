            Salutations! I'm Bradley Hill, and I'm excited to welcome you to my
            portfolio project. Crafted with Next.js, this site not only
            showcases my technical skills but also serves as a platform for
            potential employers to explore my journey into the world of tech.

            Over the past 9 months at Ada Tech School in Nantes, my self-taught
            journey from the 2021 Covid-19 Lockdown in England evolved into a
            comprehensive study of tech and coding. With a foundation in
            HTML/CSS and JavaScript, I've delved into TypeScript, frameworks
            like Vue/React/Next and Nuxt, and expanded my knowledge to include
            PHP, Java, SQL,Python and computer science fundamentals.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 max-w-2xl text-xl text-gray-500 lg:mx-auto">
            One highlight of my Ada Tech School experience has been working on
            collaborative projects, providing me with invaluable insights into
            teamworking in a new environment and the different professional
            methodologies. This contrasts with my earlier self-study and allows
            me the opportunity to apply my skills in new settings.

            Now on the lookout for a 12-month apprenticeship, I'm eager to
            translate my skills into real-world applications. My apprenticeship
            would have a pattern of Monday to Thursday in the workplace, with
            Fridays dedicated to advancing my learning at Ada Tech School. Let's
            connect and explore how I can contribute to your team!
